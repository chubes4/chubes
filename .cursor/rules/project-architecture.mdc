# Project Architecture: chubes.net WordPress Theme

## Purpose
This project is a custom WordPress theme for https://chubes.net, built and maintained by Chris Huber. Its primary purpose is to serve as a personal/professional hub, portfolio, and service showcase for Chris Huber, highlighting his work as a WordPress developer, creative entrepreneur, and digital strategist. The site also acts as a lead generation platform and a content/community hub.

## File Structure Overview
- **404.php, front-page.php, home.php, index.php, page-*.php, single.php, archive-*.php**: WordPress template files for various site views.
- **footer.php, header.php**: Global layout and navigation.
- **functions.php**: Theme setup, asset enqueuing (with dynamic versioning), and global hooks.
- **css/**: Modular CSS files for specific pages and features.
- **js/**: JavaScript for interactivity, AJAX, and page-specific features.
- **php/**: Modular PHP files for custom features, forms, and integrations (e.g., contact forms, breadcrumbs, plugin logic).
- **fonts/**: Custom font and SVG icon assets.
- **style.css**: Main theme stylesheet and WordPress theme header.
- **README.md**: Minimal project description.

## Major Features & Architecture

### 1. Theme Setup & Asset Management
- `functions.php` sets up theme supports (title, thumbnails, logo, menus, editor styles).
- CSS/JS enqueued with dynamic versioning using `filemtime` for cache busting.
- Page-specific assets loaded conditionally (e.g., home, services, portfolio archive).
- All PHP files in `/php/` auto-included for modularity.

### 2. Navigation & Layout
- `header.php` and `footer.php` provide global navigation, including a fullscreen overlay menu and social links.
- Breadcrumbs implemented via `php/breadcrumbs.php` for SEO and navigation clarity.

### 3. Contact & Lead Generation
- Multiple custom contact/quote forms (in `/php/` and page templates) for:
  - General contact (`page-contact.php`)
  - Web development (`php/web-development-contact.php`)
  - WordPress customization (`php/wordpress-customization-contact.php`)
  - Boat industry websites (`php/boat-website-contact.php`)
  - AI integration (`php/ai-integration-contact-form.php`)
  - Free local SEO audits (`php/free-local-seo-audits.php`)
  - Service quote requests (`php/get-a-quote.php`, `page-services.php`)
- All forms use honeypot and timestamp anti-spam, sanitize input, and send admin/user emails.
- AJAX handlers for forms are registered for both logged-in and guest users.

### 4. Portfolio & Content
- Portfolio and journal/blog archives via custom templates (`archive-portfolio.php`, `archive-journal.php`).
- Blog content managed via `home.php` and `index.php`.
- Portfolio post type (details in code, not in this doc) used for project showcases.

### 5. Customizer & Theme Options
- `php/customizer.php` adds customizer controls for images and trust logos.

### 6. JavaScript Features
- Page-specific JS for modals, AJAX forms, and interactive UI (e.g., `js/services.js`, `js/reveal.js`, `js/load-more.js`).
- Data passed from PHP to JS via `wp_localize_script` (naming convention: *_params or *_vars).

### 7. Security & Performance
- WordPress version removed from output for security.
- Emoji scripts disabled for performance.

## Data Key Naming Conventions
- Data passed from PHP to JS uses the suffix `_params` or `_vars` (e.g., `web_dev_contact_params`, `loadmore_params`).

## Known Contradictions/Redundancies
- None currently documented. If found, note here and address in the next update.
