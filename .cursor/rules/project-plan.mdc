# Project Plan: chubes.net

## High Priority
- Redesign homepage to be less service-oriented and introduce:
  - WordPress Plugins section (showcase, download, and upsell pro versions)
  - Games section (feature selected games, link to game archives, and individual game pages)
- Implement pageview tracking for game posts (to enable popularity sorting)
- Plan and implement plugin distribution and licensing system (universal licensing plugin, pro license purchase flow)

## Medium Priority
- Determine best content model for plugins (custom post type vs. pages vs. portfolio with categories)
- Add GitHub/source code links for all public plugins and games
- Add documentation pages for each plugin and game
- Refactor portfolio post type to clearly separate plugins, games, and general projects

## Low Priority
- Add more minigames (e.g., Snake, Tower Defense, Trivia, etc.)
- Add community features (e.g., comments, leaderboards, Discord integration)
- Improve blog/journal content and archives

## Ideas
- Integrate Data Machine publishing engine as a showcase or SaaS
- Add case studies for automation, AI, and outreach tools
- Highlight Extra Chill projects (Linktree alt, bbPress forum, AI bot)
- Add Chrome extension showcase/download page
- Add generators (rap name, band name, etc.) as interactive tools or blocks
- Consider combining or modularizing plugin codebases for maintainability

# Notes
- All completed steps should be deleted from this file and documented in project-architecture.mdc.
- This document is forward-looking only; see project-architecture.mdc for current state.
